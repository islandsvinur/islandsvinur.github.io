<p>I <a href="http://ijsland.luijten.org/">opened a new blog</a> today, which sole purpose will be to log the events from now until I&#8217;m back from Iceland. The language will be Dutch, since it will also be the communication channel for me to my family and friends while I&#8217;m away.</p> 	<p>And as an extra service: <a href="http://ijsland.luijten.org/feed/">A direct link to the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed.</a></p>
