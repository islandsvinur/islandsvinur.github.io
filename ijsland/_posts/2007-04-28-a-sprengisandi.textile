<p>While it is not very uncommon to see advertisers go to Iceland to use the magnificient landscape as a backdrop for their productions (<a href="http://www.axe.nl/home/index.php?ID=commercials&#38;S=bomchickawahwah&#38;C">Axe also does it</a>= for their self-tanning body lotion stuff by the way), it is pretty uncommon to hear Icelandic folksongs on Dutch television.</p> 	<p>Mentos in their new series of demonstrating the freshness of their stuff show the people of Grundafjurdhuhurdhur (actually there is a town called <a href="http://www.grundarfjordur.is/">Grundarfj&ouml;r&eth;ur</a> on the Sn&aelig;fellsnes peninsula) involved in some refreshing bath in the fjord filled with Mentosessess (pun intended).</p> 	<p>Another installment shows the refreshing of some guy&#8217;s mouth by first throwing a bucket over his head to protect the others from the bad smell and then hanging him in some construction to put him headfirst in a tub filled with Mentosses.</p> 	<p>Anyway, the song they sing at the end is a song about a horseback tour through the Sprengisandur desert. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://audio.luijten.org/iceland/a-sprengisandi.mp3">&Aacute; Sprengisandi</a> and was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%ADmur_Thomsen">Gr&iacute;mur Thomsen</a> who lived from 1820 to 1896:</p> <blockquote> <p> R&iacute;&eth;um, r&iacute;&eth;um og rekum yfir sandinn, <br /> rennur s&oacute;l &aacute; bak vi&eth; Arnarfell, <br /> h&eacute;r &aacute; reiki er margur &oacute;hreinn andinn, <br /> &uacute;r &thorn;v&iacute; fer a&eth; skyggja &aacute; j&ouml;kulsvell; <br /> Drottinn lei&eth;i dr&ouml;sulinn minn, <br /> drj&uacute;gur ver&eth;ur s&iacute;&eth;asti &aacute;fanginn. </p> <p> &THORN;ey &thorn;ey! &thorn;ey &thorn;ey! &THORN;aut &iacute; holti t&oacute;a, <br /> &thorn;urran vill h&uacute;n bl&oacute;&eth;i v&aelig;ta g&oacute;m, <br /> e&eth;a l&iacute;ka einvher var a&eth; h&oacute;a <br /> undarlega digrum karlar&oacute;m. <br /> &uacute;tilegumenn &iacute; &Oacute;d&aacute;&eth;ahraun <br /> eru kannski a&eth; smala f&eacute; &aacute; laun.  </p> <p> R&iacute;&eth;um, r&iacute;&eth;um og rekum yfir sandinn, <br /> rokkri&eth; er a&eth; s&iacute;ga &aacute; Herdubrei&eth; <br /> &Aacute;lfadrottning er a&eth; beisla gandinn, <br /> ekki er gott a&eth; ver&eth;a &aacute; hennar lei&eth; <br /> V&aelig;nsta kl&aacute;rinn vildi &eacute;g gefa til <br /> a&eth; vera kominn ofan &iacute; Ki&eth;agil. </p> </blockquote> 	<p>The first strophe roughly translates to:</p> 	<blockquote> 	<p>Ride, ride, ride over the sand, <br /> Run with the sun behind Arnarfell, <br /> Bad spirits/winds come and go here. <br /> Dusk is falling on the gletscher ice, <br /> God leads my horse, <br /> Long will be the last stage.</p> 	</blockquote> 	<p>You won&#8217;t find a Icelander that doesn&#8217;t know this song. It&#8217;s quite funny to hear this familiar tune in an advertisement, since we also had it at the Icelandic course last August as part of our cultural programme :-)</p>
