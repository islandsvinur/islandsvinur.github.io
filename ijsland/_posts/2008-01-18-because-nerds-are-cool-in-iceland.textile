<p>Gelezen op <a href="http://blog.icelandexpress.com/iceland/2008/01/18/because-nerds-are-cool-in-iceland/">How do you like Iceland?</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <h2>Because Nerds are Cool in Iceland</h2> <p>A laptop in Reykjavik is like a guitar-case on the continent: it doesn't matter what you're doing with it, just carrying one around increases your chances of getting lucky.</p> <p>Imagine using your computer in a pub back home; everybody would look at you like you're barmy... before turning back to the television that's blaring away in the corner, that is. Nearly all bars in Reykjavik are TV-free, thankfully, but what's even better is that being a nerd is actually considered cool in Iceland, and you can surf the net in the pub without anybody thinking any the less of you for it.</p> </blockquote> 	<p>Zo heel erg waar, lees nog maar eens wat ik op <a href="http://ijsland.luijten.org/2006/08/09/daar-zit-je-dan/">9 augustus</a> en <a href="http://ijsland.luijten.org/2006/10/30/aboutblank-een-stage-in-ijsland-in-weblogs/">30 oktober</a> 2006 op m&#8217;n IJslandblog schreef.</p>
