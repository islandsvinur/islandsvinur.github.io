content: "<p>Today (yesterday if you like) <a href=\"http://utopiamoo.net/\">Utopia</a> held its annual <a href=\"http://hccdagen.nl/\"><span class=\"caps\">HCC</span> Dagen</a> meeting!</p> \t<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://luijten.org/image/photos/utopia-hcc-2005.png\" alt=\"\" /><br /> <em><span class=\"caps\">HDD</span> enclosure I bought this year, with Tux of 4 years ago</em></p> \t<p>The number of merchants was saddingly low, they even had to close down two half halls (and the worst: the most interesting stuff was traditionally in those two halls). I fear for the existence of the current setup; the goods the shops had to offer was thirteen-in-a-dozen standard stuff and all the same.</p> \t<p>Where did the times go where you could find the most obscure hardware at the <span class=\"caps\">HCC</span> Dagen? Where were the big companies like Philips? Intel had a modest stand. Even Microsoft didn&#8217;t have a big over-the-top stand this year. Not that I was in any way interested in those, but they bring a lot of money in the organisation.</p> \t<p><a href=\"http://fotos.luijten.org/v/Christian/200511/HCC/\">Photos of the meeting</a> are online, waiting to be integrated in the Utopia website.</p>"
