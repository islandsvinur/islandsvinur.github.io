Of course I <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/maps/bin/request.py?contact_type=report\">reported</a> this to Google.</p> \t<p>It&#8217;s quite an old photo, the bridge over the Rhine they are building in the left is in service a few years already.</p> \t<p><strong>Update</strong>: In the meantime, Google Maps was updated extensively (higher resolution pictures are now available of the area) and the error has been removed.</p>"
