    Some ten years ago, I started this blog to document my switch to the
    PowerPC platform. Gradually it changed into a general purpose blog
    with ramblings about just about anything I _dared_ to share.
    Sometimes, I would not write about some subject because I cared too
    much about what others think.
    
    Times have changed. I have stopped worrying about what others think
    about me and my writings. This is just for fun and it should always
    be just for fun.
    
    So here it is, hopefully a new and fresh start of Logging the
    Switch... Yeah, I'll have to think of another title.
