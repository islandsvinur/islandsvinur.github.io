    "!(right)/image/rants.gif!":/tags/rants/ A great idea this week by the high
    speed train operators Eurostar, Deutsche Bahn, SNCF, SNCB, NS Hispeed,
    &Ouml;BB, SBB and Thalys, Lyria and Alleo; they're going to create a single
    tariff system for their combined high speed rail system.  Reductions and
    special offers in one country will be available to customers in all the
    other countries etc. One step closer to a united Europe.
    
    So far, so good. I found out however that while the tariffs become clearer,
    the names don't. Today on the website of Deutsche Bahn I saw the mention of
    an "ICE Sprinter":http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICE_Sprinter, which is an
    extra fast "InterCityExpress":http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterCityExpress
    train that halts only on a few stations on the line, thereby winning time.
    French long-distance TGVs do this by default.
    
    Ironically (?),
    "Sprinters":http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadsgewestelijk_Materieel are the
    new and hip trade name (well actually the name existed already since the
    70s for the SGMs) of commuter/regional trains of the "Nederlandse
    Spoorwegen":http://www.ns.nl/ - replacing the clear but rather dull name
    "Stoptrein":http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoptrein. Now, I don't know how
    it is in the rest of the world, but commuter trains are quite the opposite
    of extra fast.
    
    Both sides have a fair argument for their choice of name; Sprinters are
    usually fast (point for DB), but they're also specialised at short
    distances (point for NS).
    
    One Europe, what a great idea. Let's start with common and clear names for
    our products.
