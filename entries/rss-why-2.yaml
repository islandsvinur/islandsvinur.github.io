title: RSS, two and a half years later
author: christian
content: <p>Two and a half years ago I wrote <a href="http://luijten.org/personal/rss-why-1.html">an article</a> (has it been that long, time really flies) about the state and future of <span class="caps">RSS</span>. I thought it would be nice to revisit this article and delibrate on the next steps.</p> 	<p>The first problem I brought up was the fact that it is a poll system, as opposed to an event-based system. I asserted that if <span class="caps">RSS</span> wants to be successful, it has to be converted into a push method. Well, I was quite wrong :-) It turned out to be so successful that there are now companies and services that only publish <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds from other feeds (<a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a>, <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>).</p> 	<p class="right"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/podcast.png" title="Apple's Podcast icon" alt="Apple's Podcast icon" /></p> 	<p>Something which developed very quickly during the end of 2004 was a thing called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasting</a>. Audio and video files are enclosed in the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed and can be automatically downloaded by a newsreader or &#8220;podcatcher&#8221;. Many podcasts exist, most are of questionable quality, but some stand out, just like with written weblogs.</p> 	<p>The idea of podcasting caught quite a bit of attention and the relatively simple technology behind it created a slew of more or less successful ideas. <a href="http://apple.com/">Apple</a> thought of photocasting where the iPhoto application creates <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds with an item for each photo that is to be published. Other users of iPhoto can then subscribe to the feed and get automatic updates of others&#8217; photos. It didn&#8217;t really catch on, although <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is now offering <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds with photos enclosed which can be used with iPhoto (or any other feed reader, for that matter).</p> 	<p class="left"><img src="http://planet.luon.net/images/faces/christian.png" title="Hackergotchi" alt="Hackergotchi" /></p> 	<p>In Free Software development circles, a Python script called <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet</a> became popular <a href="http://planet.luon.net/">to</a> <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">aggregate</a> <a href="http://planet.debian.net/">the</a> <a href="http://planetkde.org/">weblogs</a> <a href="http://planet.freedesktop.org/">of</a> <a href="http://planet.go-oo.org/">the</a> <a href="http://planet.jabber.org/">many</a> <a href="http://planet.mozilla.org/">developers</a> <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/planet/">working</a> <a href="http://www.planetapache.org/">on</a> <a href="http://planet.adiumx.com/">a project</a>. The <a href="http://luijten.org/geek-stuff/hacking/hackergotchi.html">Hackergotchi</a>, a small picture with or without fancy drop shadow to identify authors of the different posts was born.</p> 	<p>The simple way in which <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds can be parsed and extended, thanks to <span class="caps">XML</span>, generates new applications every day. <span class="caps">RSS</span> no longer is solely a way of delivering blog content to the end user, it isn&#8217;t even bound to things happening over time anymore. It has become a standardized way to exchange content of any kind.</p> 	<p>It is an important step in the becoming of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a>, where every piece of information is put into context and accessible from anywhere using any device. It was a driving force in the success of the Web 2.0 bubble which didn&#8217;t burst like the first.</p> 	<p>Advertising companies understood the possibilities of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and started offering advertisements for inclusion in feeds, either in the form of a banner in the footer of posts, or as advertorials in separate feed items.</p> 	<p class="right"><img src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20.png" title="Creative Commons - Some rights reserved" alt="Creative Commons - Some rights reserved" /></p> 	<p>Recently, a discussion about the copyrights of feeds came up when <a href="http://frank-ly.nl/verandering-in-de-rechten-van-de-webfeed">some</a> <a href="http://www.yme.nl/ymerce/2007/04/13/original-signal-klopt-dit-wel/">people</a> <a href="http://www.marketingfacts.nl/berichten/20070415_hoe_ver_mag_je_gaan_met_de_rss_feed_van_anderen/">discovered</a> that their feeds were aggregated by a commercial site which put advertisements in their posts (thereby possibly exercising their fair-use rights). They responded by relicensing the feed under a non-commercial Creative Commons license. They have no problem with people earning money with what they write, they <em>do</em> have a problem with people earning money with their writings without sharing or even telling.</p> 	<p><em>So, what do you think, will the article I will write two and a half years from now still be about <span class="caps">RSS</span>? Or will we arrive at a better technology? What will be the challenges for the next years? Will this technology or its successor ever become so user friendly your mother would use it?</em></p> 	<p><em>I&#8217;ve added comments to the site, just follow the link below and leave a message!</em></p> 	<p><strong>Update:</strong> I found this <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english">little video trying to explain <span class="caps">RSS</span> in plain English</a>. I think this still is way too technical, but it&#8217;s a start.</p>
