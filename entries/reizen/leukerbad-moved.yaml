    I moved the posts of the "holidays in
    Leukerbad":/page/holidays/leukerbad/intro.html to the archive. This way, it
    won't show up anymore in the sections sidebar, but in the static section of
    the site.
    
    Because of the ordering of the journal, the holiday diaries should be read
    in reverse order. I'll look into it to check whether it is possible to
    define your own ordering, thus enabling an ascending chronological order
    (instead of descending like in the journal).
