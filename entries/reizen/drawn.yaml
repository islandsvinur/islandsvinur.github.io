I was number 6.</p> 	<p>For the remaining 14 mathematics students, case studies will have to be found, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll manage.</p> 	<p>In the end it will mean that we probably are going with 27 after all.</p> 	<p>And now? Now we wait for our case study to come available and the excursions and lectures to prepare for the tour.</p>
