content: <p>As a regular <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/">Rocketboom</a> viewer, I was <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/12/rb_06_dec_14.html">introduced in December</a> to the german show <a href="http://www.ehrensenf.de/">Ehrensenf</a> (ES) (anagram of Fernsehen, or television), which I since then catch daily, too.</p> 	<p class="center"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/ehrensenf.png" alt="" /></p> 	<p>ES reached 300 episodes today! Congratulations!</p> 	<p>While it seems to be a copy of Rocketboom at first sight, be it in German, the show turns out to be quite fun to watch <em>and</em> to be different.</p> 	<p>Both shows are produced and scripted, but most hosts of ES (they have &#8220;backups&#8221; so to say in case Katrin is on the road for <a href="http://www.3sat.de/">3sat</a> or otherwise busy for the radio or her studies in technical journalism) are in my opinion better than Joanne from Rocketboom. It just looks a bit more spontaneous, less rehearsed.</p> 	<p>ES is funny, despite the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_humour">Germans are thought of to have no humour at all</a> (which is true in many cases, especially TV shows) and even though the ES team is from Cologne (and thus not from D&uuml;sseldorf).</p> 	<p>That being said, I think the Netherlands lack a <em>good</em> light news internet-tv show, but somehow I just can&#8217;t imagine it happening here. The only site I would expect to come out with such a thing would be Geenstijl&#8230; Yay, what fun would that be&#8230; <em>(pause)</em> NOT!</p>
