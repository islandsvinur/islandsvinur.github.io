title: iPod shuffle

content: "<p>I completely forgot I promised to write something about my iPod shuffle. So here you have it:</p> \t<p>Many words have been said now about the shuffle by many users and I just can&#8217;t add much to that. It sounds all right, the electronic sounds of <a href=\"http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/\">Sigur R\xC3\xB3s</a> tend to clip (can also be an encoding problem, but I don&#8217;t hear them that clear on my stereo) and switches slow between songs (about a second silence between each track which really is too ong). It might also give some audible feedback when pushing the buttons. Here are some interesting links about iPod shuffle.</p> \t<ul> \t<li><a href=\"http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/996841\">Apple Talk on Gathering of Tweakers</a> (sorry, in Dutch) </li> \t<li><a href=\"http://forums.ipodlounge.com/showthread.php?threadid=74274&#38;perpage=15&#38;pagenumber=1\">One of the first iPod shuffle covers</a> and absolutely beautiful. The guy seems to got a lot of success by just putting some nice pics online :-)</li> \t<li><a href=\"http://www.bootykika.com/images/shuffle_frisk_large.jpg\">A funny mod,</a> probably a weak pun on <a href=\"http://images.apple.com/nl/ipodshuffle/images/indexwithgum20050111.jpg\">Apple&#8217;s comparison</a></li> \t</ul> \t<p>Okay, so that is what they say and do with it. I had my own personal iPod experience. About a week after I had activated it, the left headphone started to make a cracking noise. That was a bit disappointing, but since I of course have warranty, I called Apple and they sent me a new pair without any question. Way to go, Apple! Excellent!</p>"
