title: Mac mini in the living room

content: <p>Today we moved the Mac mini from the study into the living room. Not because my mom wanted it, but because we&#8217;re going to be renovating the study and that can take some time, so the machine has to be somewhere. This isn&#8217;t bad at all, since it is warmer in the living room.</p>
