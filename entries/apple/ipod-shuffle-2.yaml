title: iPod shuffle on holiday
author: christian
content: <p>My shuffle had its longest time without refill this holiday and I must say, two weeks is definitely too long for this device. After a week, you&#8217;ve heard every song and you&#8217;re in need of a change.</p> 	<p>That I couldn&#8217;t update it was of course my own fault, since I had a laptop with me, also loaded with music. I just have to find out which free app is the best for updating iPods (in Linux).</p>
