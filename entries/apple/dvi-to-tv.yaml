content: <p>Okay, after some bumps in the road thanks to a nice guy of <span class="caps">TNT</span>, the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=M9267G/A"><span class="caps">DVI</span>-to-TV cable</a> arrived today.</p> 	<p><img src="http://luijten.org/image/dvi-to-tv.jpg" class="right" alt="" /> Yesterday, 11:18, I wasn&#8217;t at home, according to this person called Sabayo. I was however, and today at 11:58, the same Sabayo didn&#8217;t ring twice to deliver my package. Mildly irritated I called <span class="caps">TNT</span> at about 12:05 why I was at home and no one rang, but wrote a nice note for me. The guy at the other end didn&#8217;t understand either, but convinced the postman to come by my house again on his way back. And this way, at 15:51, the bag (the package I mean, not the postman) came after all.</p> 	<p>Of course, I wanted to try it out immediately, but since I don&#8217;t have a television in my room, I first had to borrow the one from the kitchen. And find a cable. And find a new cable since the first one apparantly was broken as it only gave a distorted image once and then became completely silent. I almost thought I had a case of <span class="caps">DOA</span>, but luckily, with the new cable, the image was as bright and clear as it could possibly be on a television screen.</p> 	<p>So, for those who thought I bought a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> , you thought wrong. For those who thought I bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod shuffle</a> , you were right. I also bought an iPod shuffle :-) More about that later.</p>
