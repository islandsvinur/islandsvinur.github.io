title: Day 5. Bad weather day
author: christian
content: "<p>The day started very nice, with sun and 25\xC2\xBAC on the balcony&#8230; But by 11 o&#8217;clock, the weather changed dramatically. The temperature sank to a mere 15 degrees and rain came over the valley.</p> \t<p>Since we already knew this would happen from the weather forecast, we hadn&#8217;t planned anything for the day. This was a nice day for watching <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207275/\">The 10th Kingdom</a>.</p>"
