title: Finally! Hypermedia Structures and Systems is Finished
author: christian
content: <p>Yes! Finally I got around it and actually finished the work I started more than <a href="http://luijten.org/study/trimester-4.1.html">two years ago</a> (uh, correction, <a href="http://luijten.org/study/holidays-2005.html">almost two and a half years ago</a>)!</p> 	<p>The course is taught online, with a hyperdocument as course material. You first read your way through the hundred-something pages and a few small quizzes.</p> 	<p>In the end you get the <span class="caps">HTML</span>&#8217;ized version of a (online) paper written in 1993 by Vijay Balasubramanian titled &#8220;State of the Art Review on Hypermedia Issues And Applications&#8221; and the assignment to convert it into a hypertext document.</p> 	<p>In 1994 it was <a href="http://www.e-papyrus.com/hypertext_review/index.html">converted to <span class="caps">HTML</span></a> by Denys Duchier and now in 2007, for the <a href="http://sandcat.nl/~bazkar/2L690/contents.html">I</a> <a href="http://www.meneerbruggeman.nl/2L690/hyperdocument/title.html">don&#8217;t</a> <a href="http://hypermedia.reynout.nl/">know</a> <a href="http://tue.markdehaas.nl/2l690/solution/introduction.html">how</a> <a href="http://paul.luon.net/hypermedia/">many&#8217;th</a> time it is converted into an actual hypertext document. <a href="http://hypermedia.luijten.org/">So here&#8217;s my take at it</a>.</p> 	<p>J&aelig;, so I&#8217;m now only one course short of my Bachelor degree, which is that other course I &#8220;started&#8221; two years ago; History of Computing. I also am only one course and a Master project short of my Master degree, so it&#8217;s actually looking like it&#8217;s coming to an end now! More about the Master project in a few weeks.</p>
