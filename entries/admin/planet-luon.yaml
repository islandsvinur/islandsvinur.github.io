title: Orion back once again and Planet Luon
author: christian
content: <p>Well, revived Orion once again, this time back in its old case with its old mainboard and all is back as it was before we got the new (cursed?) hardware. So I just hope things will run smoothly until I say it to stop instead of stopping on its own.</p> 	<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://paul.luon.net/journal/">Paul</a> and Bram apparently created <a href="http://planet.luon.net/">Planet Luon</a> and put me on it, so you&#8217;ll find my journal there as well! A two-feed planet is kind of boring I thought, but it appears that both <a href="http://luon.net/~admar/journal">Admar</a> and <a href="http://weatherwax.luon.net/~bram/">Bram</a> started blogging this month, so now we&#8217;re four.</p>
