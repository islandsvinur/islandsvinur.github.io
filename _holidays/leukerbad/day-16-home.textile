<p>Woohoo! We made it! We spent the night in the luxureous <a href="http://www.lindner.de/de/LHB/index_html/complexdoc_view">Lindner Binshof hotel &amp; spa</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=49.362980,8.451490&#38;spn=0.048855,0.069064&#38;t=k&#38;hl=en">Speyer</a> for a ridiculously low fare &#8211; thank you for having family in the hotel business ;-)</p> 	<p>Okay, so now, mail, feeds, uploading this, reading elfjes and pijlen in <a href="http://utopiamoo.net/">Utopia</a> and <a href="http://medievalmoo.nl/">Medieval</a>, get the stuff here together, finding out who Marijke is who gave me money for using the washing machine, and oh yeah, first a nice shower.</p>
