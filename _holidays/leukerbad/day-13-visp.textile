<p>Nothing special today, a trip to the town <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.293816,7.884922&#38;spn=0.051833,0.069064&#38;t=k&#38;hl=en">Visp</a>, kind of shopping tour, but all shops close at 5. Went to Carrefour afterwards, also closing at 5 and since we left home at around 2, we didn&#8217;t really have time to do anything (which suits me, I hate shopping).</p> 	<p>Holiday&#8217;s end is in sight, we&#8217;re slowly getting everything ready for the way back, tidying, packing, getting some specialities of the region for at home&#8230; I don&#8217;t know yet what we&#8217;re doing tomorrow, but I suppose there still is a lot to pack and move around. Monday morning at nine we are supposed to leave the apartment.</p> 	<p>It&#8217;s sad to leave, but it is also good to return home, where I can finally post these sixteen notes, get the photos, read e-mail (ugh, that&#8217;s going to be a lot), read feeds (luckily, they are time-limited), listen new podcasts, update the site to a new layout and&#8230; <em>aaaargh</em>! prepare for exams. I took all stuff with me, but I didn&#8217;t really have the time to read it.</p>
