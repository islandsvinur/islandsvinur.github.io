<p>A walk to the <a href="http://www.weidstuebli.ch/">WeidstÃ¼bli</a> today for a hot meal. One hour and a half walking to, and an hour back.</p> 	<p>The first new snow fell today above the 3 kilometers, I think I even saw Rudi already rushing home. Indeed, this first snowfall introduces the winter, according to D.</p>
