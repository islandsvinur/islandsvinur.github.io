<p>It&#8217;s time to leave Leukerbad, everything is packed and we&#8217;re aiming for a night in Karlsruhe, Speyer or Koblenz. In Speyer it is a hotel of the <a href="http://www.lindner-hotels.de/">Lindner</a> group, the one DK works for, so maybe we will get a discount ;-).</p> 	<p><a href="http://luijten.org/image/holidays/leukerbad/sheep-geissweg.jpg"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/holidays/leukerbad/sheep-geissweg-small.jpg" alt="" /></a> Yesterday we (dad and I) took a short walk on the Geissweg, a path along the slope of the Gemmi mountain with a great view on the entire town &#8211; very unique actually to see the town in whole. Mom stayed home and we would call her when we get there so that we could take a picture of our home with her on the balcony :-)</p>
