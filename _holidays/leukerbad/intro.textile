<p>This wasn&#8217;t planned, but my parents rented an appartment in the Swiss village of <a href="http://www.leukerbad.ch/">Leukerbad</a> for two weeks. My cousin works there in a hotel and many colleagues own an extra appartment to put it on for rent.</p> 	<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the place, only that it is in the canton Wallis (Valais) and at about 1500 meters and also has a hot water source of about 42 degrees Celsius.</p> 	<p>There is a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.378355,7.627430&#38;spn=0.048923,0.048516&#38;t=k&#38;hl=en">satellite picture</a> on <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google maps</a> which gives a rough idea where it is situated, but nothing more than that: Details aren&#8217;t yet available.</p> 	<p>My laptop travels with me, so I&#8217;ll try to post something throughout the weeks and if I can get an internet connection I&#8217;ll even try to put the posts online. If not, you&#8217;ll have to read a lot of posts at once :-) We&#8217;ll leave next Sunday and will return somewhere around the 5th of August.</p>
