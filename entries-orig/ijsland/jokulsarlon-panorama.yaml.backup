content: "<p>Played a bit with some photos I had still laying around waiting to be processed and found the seven images that make up the following panoramic image of J&ouml;kuls&aacute;rl&oacute;n in Iceland. That&#8217;s the same lake as you see in the header, except the photographer thereof was a bit more lucky with the weather :-).</p> \t<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://luijten.org/photos/iceland/jokulsarlon-panorama-very-small.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> \t<p>Anyway, the full size picture is over 28 megapixel large, I also have <a href=\"http://luijten.org/photos/iceland/jokulsarlon-panorama-small.jpg\">a smaller version</a>, still around 2 megapixel.</p> \t<p>If you&#8217;d want to print the full size: at 150 dpi it would be 2m50 by 30cm.</p>"
