content: <p>Here&#8217;s another beautiful Icelandic song, <a href="http://audio.luijten.org/iceland/maistjarnan.mp3">Ma&iacute;stjarnan</a> (the May star). By Halld&oacute;r Laxness, written in 1937.</p> <blockquote class="narrow left"> &Oacute; hve l&eacute;tt er &thorn;itt sk&oacute;hlj&oacute;&eth; <br /> og hve lengi &eacute;g bei&eth; &thorn;&iacute;n, <br /> &thorn;ar er vorhret &aacute; glugga, <br /> napur vindur sem hv&iacute;n, <br /> en &eacute;g veit eina stj&ouml;rnu, <br /> eina stj&ouml;rnu sem sk&iacute;n, <br /> og n&uacute; loks ertu komin, <br /> &thorn;&uacute; ert komin til m&iacute;n. 	<p>&THORN;a&eth; eru erfi&eth;ir t&iacute;mar, <br /> &thorn;a&eth; er atvinnu&thorn;ref, <br /> &eacute;g hef ekkert a&eth; bj&oacute;&eth;a, <br /> ekki &ouml;gn sem &eacute;g gef, <br /> nema von m&iacute;na og l&iacute;f mitt <br /> hvort &eacute;g vaki e&eth;a sef, <br /> &thorn;etta eitt sem &thorn;&uacute; gafst m&eacute;r <br /> &thorn;a&eth; er alt sem &eacute;g hef.</p> En &iacute; kv&ouml;ld l&yacute;kur vetri <br /> s&eacute;rhvers vinnandi manns, <br /> og &aacute; morgun sk&iacute;n ma&iacute;s&oacute;l, <br /> &thorn;a&eth; er ma&iacute;s&oacute;lin hans, <br /> &thorn;a&eth; er ma&iacute;s&oacute;lin okkar, <br /> okkar ein&iacute;ngarbands, <br /> fyrir &thorn;&eacute;r ber &eacute;g f&aacute;na <br /> &thorn;essa framt&iacute;&eth;arlands.  </blockquote> <blockquote class="narrow right"> Oh how light are your footsteps, <br /> Oh how long have I waited for you, <br /> There is spring rain on the window, <br /> Cold whistling wind, <br /> but I know one star, <br /> one shining star, <br /> and now finally are you coming, <br /> you are coming to me. 	<p>It are hard times, <br /> there&#8217;s not a lot work, <br /> I&#8217;ve got nothing to offer, <br /> not a bit which I give, <br /> except my hope and my life, <br /> whether I&#8217;m awake or asleep. <br /> This one thing you gave me, <br /> that is all I have.</p> But tonight winter ends <br /> for every working man, <br /> and in the morning shines the May star, <br /> that is his May sun, <br /> that is our May sun, <br /> our uniting bond. <br /> For you I carry the flag <br /> of this land&#8217;s future. </blockquote> 	<p class="clear">The song being written in 1937, when Iceland was still a dependent nation under Danish flag&#8212;the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Denmark">Dannebrog</a>&#8212;I assume &#8220;the flag of this land&#8217;s future&#8221; being a forward reference to the current flag and thus independence.</p> 	<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the May star is, but I would say it is the sun, having returned with full force, starting to lighten up (and warm up!) the country after the hard and dark winter. Since a few days, Iceland doesn&#8217;t have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_twilight">civil twilight</a> anymore for three months to come; the sun sets and doesn&#8217;t go more than 6&deg; under the horizon before climbing again for a new day.</p>
