author: christian
content: <p>Read a <a href="http://icelandreport.blogspot.com/2005/11/american-style.html">kinda funny entry</a> on the Iceland Report (found it via the <a href="http://noisedfisk.com/">Noisedfisk</a> weblog, very interesting if you&#8217;re interested in Nordic culture) about a new &#8220;American style&#8221; restaurant called American Style in downtown Reykjav&iacute;k.</p> 	<p>It made me think of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0110912/">Pulp Fiction</a> (the &#8220;little differences&#8221; scene) and somehow also of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0237993/">101 Reykjav&iacute;k.</a> Small quote:</p> 	<blockquote> 	<p>Last but not least, &#8220;Andskotinn, er ekki fuckin s&aelig;ti!&#8221; is not something the local burger-shack rednecks are wont to say in the US of A.</p> 	</blockquote> 	<p>&#8220;Damn, no fucking seats!&#8221;</p>
