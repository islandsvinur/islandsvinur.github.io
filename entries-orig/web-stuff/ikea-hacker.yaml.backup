Although I also read that the <span class=\"caps\">LACK</span> wall shelve was hard to install and also <span class=\"caps\">EXPEDIT</span> is causing troubles, even needing extra tools to build them&#8230;</p> \t<p>Now, I&#8217;ve seen JG (flatmate, the ones who know him should know enough ;-)) build up his <span class=\"caps\">EXPEDIT</span> on his own without any help nor did he need additional tools, so I gathered this should be doable by anyone.</p> \t<p>Maybe European build instructions are incompatible with Americans? Are our &#8220;little differences&#8221; a bit too big or does the blogger in question have two left hands?</p> \t<p>Other nice hacks:</p> \t<ul> \t<li><a href=\"http://ikeahacker.blogspot.com/2006/07/make-your-own-ikea-dna-lamp.html\">ikea dna lamp</a></li> \t<li><a href=\"http://ikeahacker.blogspot.com/2006/06/one-for-music.html\">lack music cabinet</a></li> \t<li><a href=\"http://ikeahacker.blogspot.com/2006/07/timtoms-trio-1-tupplur-home-cinema.html\">tupplur home cinema screen</a></li> \t</ul>"
