content: "<p>This weekend I was at my parents&#8217;, so no playing around with my Mac. Sunday me and my cousins went to <a href=\"http://www.sixflags.nl/\" class=\"ext\">Six Flags Holland</a> I really liked the <a href=\"http://www.rcdb.com/installationdetail1565.htm\" class=\"ext\">Goliath</a> which was so&#8230; different from what I had experienced before (and that is not much to be honest). It was my first non-<a href=\"http://www.vekoma.nl/\" class=\"ext\">Vekoma</a> coaster and what a difference indeed!</p> \t<blockquote> \t<p><strong>Update:</strong> Actually, it wasn&#8217;t my first non-Vekoma, Big Thunder Mountain (Disneyland Paris) and Bobbaan (Efteling) are no Vekoma rides.</p> \t</blockquote> \t<p>While Vekomas tend to rattle and shake, this one, of <a href=\"http://www.intaminworldwide.com/\" class=\"ext\">Intamin AG</a> was smooth like a snake. Some nice &gt;&nbsp;90\xC2\xB0 banks and air time on the bunny hops.</p> \t<p>Aw, well, I think <a href=\"http://www.rcdb.com/installationdetail769.htm\" class=\"ext\">Superman the Ride</a> is also funny with its linear motor, but that is more because it is a technical challenge to get something heavy at a high speed in short time and on such a short track.</p>"
