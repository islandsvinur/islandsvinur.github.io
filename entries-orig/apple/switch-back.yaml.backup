content: "<p>I&#8217;m switching away<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> from <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/powermac/\">PowerPC&#8230;</a> Yesterday I already installed Linux on my <a href=\"http://www.sgi.com/products/remarketed/o2plus/\"><span class=\"caps\">SGI</span> O2+</a> (MIPS <span class=\"caps\">R5000</span> architecture), today my all new and shiny white <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html\">MacBook</a> (Intel x86) arrived!</p> \t<p>You know how hard it is to to shut up to anyone about it for a whole week just to make this surprise post? Especially when you&#8217;re going to the Apple Centre with the whole bunch ;-)</p> \t<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://luijten.org/image/photos/switch-back/IMG_3619.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \t<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://luijten.org/image/photos/switch-back/IMG_3620.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \t<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://luijten.org/image/photos/switch-back/IMG_3621.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \t<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://luijten.org/image/photos/switch-back/IMG_3622.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \t<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://luijten.org/image/photos/switch-back/IMG_3623.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \t<p>First impression: Nice thing! Also ordered the mini-DVI-to-DVI cable, so I can hook it up my Dell 2405FPW and enjoy the full 1920&#215;1200! Apple removed the stupid restriction that the consumer level notebooks could only mirror the screen on the external screen, you can now also expand your desktop.</p> \t<p id=\"fn1\"><sup>1</sup> Well of course I&#8217;m only joking about switching away from my PowerMac, but it sounded cool ;-)</p>"
