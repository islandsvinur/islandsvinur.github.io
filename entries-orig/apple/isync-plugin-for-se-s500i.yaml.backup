    Alright, got my new phone today, a shiny black "Sony Ericsson
    S500i":http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&amp;lc=en&amp;ver=4000&amp;template=pip1&amp;zone=pp&amp;pid=10854
    which I chose for the looks, the fact that it's a Sony Ericsson, that it
    has Bluetooth and as such could sync with my laptop using iSync.

    iSync however didn't recognize it, because there's no "plugin" for it yet.
    Luckily there's a few companies who sell iSync "plugins" to anyone who
    needs them at rediculous prices.
    
    Because, if you delve a bit through the iSync package (the
    /Applications/iSync.app/ directory), you'll find plugins for quite some
    other phones that have been on the market earlier. Since basically the
    protocols to exchange items don't change (it's been standardized by
    "SyncML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML), the only thing that sets a
    plugin for one phone apart from that for another phone is the name and a
    pretty picture.
    
    So here you have it, an "iSync plugin for the SonyEricsson
    S500i":/files/isync-plugin-sonyericsson-s500i.zip. Create a directory in
    Library called PhonePlugins if it doesn't already exist and move the
    contents of the ZIP file there. Relaunch iSync and you should be able to
    add the device.
    
    Please leave a message if you found this page useful! Thank you!
