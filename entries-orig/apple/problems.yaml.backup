content: <p>So, I&#8217;m having some problems with my machine, of which I&#8217;m not sure it is because of the machine or from external factors.</p> 	<p>Firstly, the network is sometimes very unstable, I cannot even watch the AppleExpo keynote at 300kbps (I have a 10MBit connection) and (incoming) ssh connections also suffer from instability.</p> 	<p>Secondly, the machine tends to overheat itself and then just go into suspend, of course only if I&#8217;m away.</p> 	<p>Thirdly, it is a bit loud at night, so I can&#8217;t sleep with it on.</p>
