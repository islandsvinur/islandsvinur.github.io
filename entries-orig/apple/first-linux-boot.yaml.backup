I totally got two Tuxes&#8230; Tuces&#8230; Tuxi&#8230; Tuxii&#8230; whatever and a #-prompt.</p> \t<p>And then I remembered it was a Gentoo system and against my religion to use that, so the first command I entered was halt<enter>, which printed haltC on the prompt&#8230; Great, wrong keymap. Luckily the numpad-enter was a real enter, so I tried that one.</p>"
