title: Site update
author: christian
content: <p><img src="http://luijten.org/image/screenshot-site-2001.png" alt="" /> My old black and gray t-shirt look website is gone. I moved the journal to the root of the site, building the rest around it and am now working on creating a photogallery entry type for <a href="http://hobix.com/">Hobix,</a> my blog-software. <a href="http://christian.luijten.org/">The old site</a> will still be available on another location for a while.</p> 	<p>In my view, it was a good design, simple yet attractive. But it didn&#8217;t fit with the needs of the journal, which became an increasingly bigger part of the site. Actually it was the only part which got updates.</p> 	<p>So, like I said, I&#8217;m working on a photogallery entry type. The current status is that I have one single page with all thumbnails on it, accompanied by the image description. A click on the thumbnail opens a new window with the larger version. This is of course absolutely undesirable and I really have better ideas, but hey, it is only the first preview not-even-release. The final version should have automatic thumbnail generation, some navigational facilities (maybe using <span class="caps">AJAX</span>?) and some other cool things I don&#8217;t came up with yet (like <span class="caps">EXIF</span> information).</p> 	<p>You can already take a look at the <a href="http://luijten.org/page/photos/berlin.html">Berlin 2001</a> gallery.</p>
