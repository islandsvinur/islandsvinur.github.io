  str: <p>Just came back from Tilburg, after a long day of being jumpy (couldn&#8217;t really handle myself somehow) and <em>andskotinn</em>, what a difference with <a href="http://luijten.org/personal/music/sigur-ros-paradiso-2.html">Paradiso!</a></p> 	<p>Not that the Paradiso gig was bad, this was different! For one, 013 The Choice is much bigger. For Sigur R&oacute;s this can be both a good thing and a bad thing. They should play intimate, yet they need the space for the things Orri does to his drums ;-) Paradiso is perfectly suitable for an intimate performance, which it was, but the sound just didn&#8217;t have that <em>oomph</em> thing (although I think the bass drum was set too loud now).</p> 	<p>Okay, over to 013 then, after all I was there and not in Amsterdam today! 013 The Choice is a big hall (actually a very big staircase) with one large balcony and that&#8217;s where I went to view the whole thing. Since most things that happen on stage are small, the balcony is the perfect spot to get a good view on things. You also are quite certain that noone is standing in front of you :-)</p> 	<p>The start was the same, first came Amina, played their set <del>- with a new piece inserted between Hemipode and Seoul, I think -</del> and at the start of Amm&aelig;lis (the yet unreleased poppy electronic Kraftwerk-like piece) got people chuckling and cheering, exactly the same reaction as in Paradiso, which I found funny&#8212;and then there was the white curtain again. The lights and shadows give a very nice effect on the curtain, which I missed in Paradiso, I had a better spot this time.</p> 	<p>Curtains open, and then&#8230; no N&yacute; Batter&iacute;! Haha! Surprise! So S&aelig;gl&oacute;pur is the new &#8220;second opening&#8221; now&#8230;</p> 	<p>New songs in the set include Svo Hlj&oacute;tt and Heys&aacute;tan, more to come when I get my hands on a complete setlist&#8230; The songs just get bombarded over one, you simply cannot handle that much information!</p> 	<ol> 	<li>Takk&#8230;</li> 	<li>Gl&oacute;s&oacute;li</li> 	<li>S&aelig;gl&oacute;pur</li> 	<li>Nj&oacute;snavelin</li> 	<li>Gong</li> 	<li>Andvari</li> 	<li>Hopp&iacute;polla</li> 	<li>Me&eth; Bl&oacute;&eth;nasir</li> 	<li>Olsen Olsen</li> 	<li>Vi&eth;rar Vel Til Loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa</li> 	<li>Svo Hlj&oacute;tt</li> 	<li>Heys&aacute;tan</li> 	<li>Hafss&oacute;l</li> 	<li>Sm&aacute;skifa</li> 	<li>Popplagi&eth;</li> 	</ol> 	<p>That&#8217;s quite some change from the Paradiso set! It&#8217;s sad to see classics like N&yacute; Batter&iacute; and Sfevn-g-Englar go, but when there is a time of coming, there must be a time of going&#8230; They cannot keep on playing the old stuff over and over again, they would become like Boney M and noone wishes that for them!</p> 	<p>Hoppipolla and Me&eth; Bl&oacute;&eth;nasir belong together and are played together with only a tiny little pause in between, just enough for some in the audience to start clapping and almost immediately shut up&#8230; However, during Vi&eth;rar Vel Til Loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa, just after the &#8216;vi&eth; &aacute;ttum okkur draum, &aacute;ttum allt&#8217; line, the band just stopped for what was it&#8230; 30 seconds? Some started clapping, others shhhh&#8217;d them immediately and for about 20 seconds, 013 was completely silent&#8230; 2000 people and noone making any noise, just complete silence. I think that&#8217;s far more powerful than a stadium doing <em>eeeeeeyooooo</em>&#8217;s with the performer.</p> 	<p>As was to be expected, the concert was concluded by an extremely powerfull Popplagi&eth; (track number 8 on ( )), the curtain was closed during this song and the play of lights and shadow gave it that magical extra touch.</p> 	<p>The audience was different. In Amsterdam it was like everyone there was an artist or in some other way connected to a creative profession. In Tilburg, it looked more like <em>the concert for the rest of us</em> or something. Among them was also Ti&euml;sto by the way.</p> 	<p>I got myself a t-shirt with free stenciling of date and venue (great idea!) from the &#8220;toothfairies&#8221; of Sigur R&oacute;s&#8230; They surely know how to sell things :-)</p> 	<p>After this, we set out for home&#8230; And now I&#8217;m typing this, which costed me about&#8230; one hour to get it out of my head and hands. Still somewhat stunned.</p>
