content: "<p>Extreme bargain alert! I got this 3CD plus a <span class=\"caps\">DVD</span> with the complete recordings of The Fellowship of the Ring at a ridiculous price of \xE2\x82\xAC5,95 at Makro&#8230; Something of a 90% discount off the Amazon-prize. Someone really must have messed things up since I&#8217;ve seen it at said Makro for something around \xE2\x82\xAC 40,- not too long ago.</p> \t<p><img src=\"http://luijten.org/image/photos/fotr-complete-recordings.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \t<p>Contents:</p> \t<ul> \t<li>A booklet with information on the various themes in the music, certainly an interesting read.</li> \t<li>3CDs with the complete musical sound track of the first of the Lord of the Rings movies.</li> \t<li>1DVD which contains the same music, only now in four formats: standard Dolby Digital Stereo and Surround and in 48kHz 24bit Advanced Resolution Surround and Stereo Sound. Anyone who can play <span class=\"caps\">DVD</span>-Audio?</li> \t</ul> \t<p>It seems that software to play the <span class=\"caps\">DVD</span>-Audio portion (it&#8217;s what goes in the <span class=\"caps\">AUDIO</span>_TS directory on a <span class=\"caps\">DVD</span>) simply doesn&#8217;t exist. One has to have a hardware player for it, but now the same hardware players are dropping support for it in favour of HD content.</p> \t<p>I really enjoy this &#8220;Extended Edition&#8221; of the soundtrack, it&#8217;s fun to picture the complete film along with the music :)</p>"
