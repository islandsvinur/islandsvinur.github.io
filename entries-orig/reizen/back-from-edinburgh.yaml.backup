title: Back from Edinburgh (and more)
author: christian
content: <p>Yes, well, actually it&#8217;s been almost a month now since we came back from Edinburgh, but I didn&#8217;t want to post without <a href="http://photos.luijten.org/Christian/2006/01/">pictures being online</a> and I had to edit them plus I didn&#8217;t have a decent piece of photo gallery software.</p> 	<p>But now I do! It is called <a href="http://p.hot.os.luijten.org/">p.hot.os</a> and it is going to be my photo gallery page, so here it is, the post on Edinburgh.</p> 	<p>Actually, <em>p.hot.os</em> is nothing more than <a href="http://webgen.rubyforge.org/">webgen</a> with a custom gallery layouter (and you can even do without that one). So, basically, I now use webgen for my gallery needs! Please tell me what you think of it, I still have some ideas to implement (for instance something with Google Maps, like most of you probably already saw in my Coppermine gallery).</p> 	<p>So, back to Edinburgh&#8230; Uhm, I&#8217;m back <em>from</em> Edinburgh and it was a great weekend. We saw a lot of the city and got a hint of its surroundings, <a href="http://photos.luijten.org/Christian/2006/01/">took a lot of pictures,</a> but didn&#8217;t get on the 41 however. I&#8217;d like to thank you, Paul, for your hospitality and hope to see you soon (in a few minutes, since you&#8217;re coming home at the moment I&#8217;m writing this).</p>
