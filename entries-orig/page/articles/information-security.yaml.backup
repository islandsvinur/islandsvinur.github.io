content: <p>Among the assignments for the course of Information Security (2IF30) were two papers; an essay and a case study.</p> 	<p>The subject of the essay is &#8220;firewalls and intrusion detection&#8221;. It is in my view a very bad essay, but nonetheless it was graded 7. The <a href="http://luijten.org/files/papers/information%20security%20-%20firewalls%20and%20intrusion%20detection.pdf">full essay</a> can be downloaded here.</p> 	<p>The subject of the case study is &#8220;the Royal Dodge Airlines&#8217; <span class="caps">RFID</span> programme&#8221;. The <span class="caps">RDA</span> wants to implement a customer relationship programme with the use of <span class="caps">RFID</span> chips to identify them. This paper studies the different ways of implementing, along with their (dis)advantages. The <a href="http://luijten.org/files/papers/information%20security%20-%20royal%20dodge%20airlines%20rfid%20case%20study.pdf">full case study</a> can be downloaded here.
