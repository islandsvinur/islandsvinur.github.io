    I get many questions about &#8216;what Linux looks like&#8217;, like
    everyone wants to know &#8216;what that new Windows Vista looks
    like&#8217;. With Windows, that answer is easy, there is only one desktop
    and that desktop always has the same look: Start-button, system tray,
    taskbar, icons on the desktop and a few windows&#8230;
    
    h2. Wrong question
    
    Now, Linux is actually just a <dfn title='a piece of software that
    interacts between the applications and the hardware'>kernel</dfn>. Linux
    looks like this:
    
    <div class='scroll'> <pre> Linux NET4.0 for Linux 2.4 Based upon Swansea University Computer Society NET3.039 Initializing RT netlink socket apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.16) Starting kswapd Journalled Block Device driver loaded devfs: v1.12c (20020818) Richard Gooch (rgooch@atnf.csiro.au) devfs: boot_options: 0x1 pty: 256 Unix98 ptys configured Serial driver version 5.05c (2001-07-08) with MANY_PORTS SHARE_IRQ SERIAL_PCI enabled ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M FDC 0 is a National Semiconductor PC87306 Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 149M agpgart: Detected Intel 440BX chipset agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xe0000000 Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00beta4-2.4 ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx PIIX4: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:07.1 PIIX4: chipset revision 1 PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later ide0: BM-DMA at 0x10a0-0x10a7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio ide1: BM-DMA at 0x10a8-0x10af, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio hda: FUJITSU MHK2060AT, ATA DISK drive blk: queue c03526e0, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff) hdc: CD-224E, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive </pre>  And so on&#8230; </div> 
    
    Well, that is a bit dull, right? Right&#8230; It seems that the question
    asked is the wrong one!
    
    h2. Window managers
    
    The looks that everyone is asking for is actually the looks of the window
    manager. The window manager has various tasks, the first of course is the
    managing of the applications&#8217; windows. Managing in this case means it
    draws the borders around them, handles the moving, resizing of the window
    and input focus. There are many window managers out there, the most well
    known are <a href="http://www.windowmaker.org/">WindowMaker</a> and <a
    href="http://www.enlightenment.org/">Enlightenment.</a> The window
    manager Metacity is the current default window manager of the <acronym
    title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</acronym> 2 desktop
    environment.
    
    h2. Desktop environment
    
    I already mentioned <span class="caps">GNOME 2</span>, which is
    <em>not</em> a window manager, but a desktop environment. This will manage
    your taskbar, icons, panels <abbr title='et cetera'>etc.</abbr>. You
    won&#8217;t need a desktop environment, but if you&#8217;re coming from a
    Windows environment you&#8217;ll find it familiar using one. Known desktop
    environments are <a href="http://www.gnome.org/"><span
    class="caps">GNOME</span></a> and <a href="http://www.kde.org/"><span
    class="caps">KDE</span>.</a>
    
    h2. Widget set / Toolkit
    
    Finally, there is a third, very important factor of the looks of your Linux
    box is the choice of widget set for your applications. A widget is
    everything that can be placed on an application&#8217;s <dfn title='the
    area used by the application to show its user interface'>canvas</dfn>. It
    varies from buttons to scrollbars, <acronym title="HyperText Markup
    Language">HTML</acronym> viewers to listboxes. They enable you to
    communicate with your software application. There are many different widget
    sets, but <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">Gtk</a> (used by <span
    class="caps">GNOME</span>) and <a
    href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a> (used by <span
    class="caps">KDE</span>) are the best known.
    
    h2. Screenshots
    
    Of course, after this sermon about the how and what of the user interface
    of Linux-machines, I cannot leave you without at least one screenshot.
    
    <a href="http://luijten.org/image/screenshot-wmaker1.png"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/screenshot-wmaker1.png" class="fullWidth" title="Screenshot of WindowMaker in action" alt="Screenshot of WindowMaker in action" /></a>
    
    We see WindowMaker as the window manager, gtk+ as widgetset and I
    don&#8217;t use a desktop environment. On the right are several system
    monitors, which is a WindowMaker feature to have small 64&#215;64
    applications that show information. From top to bottom: Lock-button, Clock,
    Memory-, swapusage-, uptime- and interrupt-monitor, <span
    class="caps">CPU</span> and memory usage, network usage, sorted
    mailboxes, power management information and on the bottom there is my
    musicplayer.
    
    WindowMaker has, as almost every window manager the ability to have
    multiple desktops. I have a dedicated desktop for shell-access, one for
    Internet chat, a graphics desktop and a browser desktop. It&#8217;s a whole
    different approach than having a taskbar or something, but you get
    accustomed very fast. I switch desktops every few seconds to check if
    something has happened, imagine me having to click all the buttons on a
    taskbar, or alt-tabbing through the window list.
