title: Day 10. Excursion to Martigny
author: christian
content: <p>Went to <a href="http://www.martigny.ch/">Martigny</a> in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.105137,7.075539&#38;spn=.104023,.138127&#38;t=k&#38;hl=en">west of Valais</a>, almost at the French border. Martigny is an old Roman city, with various archaeological sites and a small amphi-theater. A section of the old road from London (to Rome of course, all roads lead to Rome) is laid free.</p> 	<p>Martigny is also the home of the <a href="http://www.gianadda.ch/">Fondation Pierre Gianadda</a>, which has a varied collection of art pieces, oldtimer cars, Gallo-Roman archaeological founds and an exposition about Leonardo da Vinci. My parents went inside, but I was at that point more interested in the town itself, so we both went our own ways. I visited the archaeological sites of a roman house and the forum, much like the ones in Vaison-la-Romaine, but I found it better preserved and restored in the Provence&#8230; Ah well, these were free to visit, so why complain ;-) Which reminds me, many historic and natural sites are free or very cheap to visit here, in contrary to other countries. The government probably invests much in education and science.</p> 	<p>Back home at dinner, a loud growling noise came from outside. I rushed to the balcony to check it out and saw a big dust cloud coming down, a big piece of rock had fallen down from the mountain.</p>
