author: christian
content: "<p>Everything is packed. I went to Van Piere yesterday for a quick holiday literature update and got <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%F6del,_Escher,_Bach\">G\xC3\xB6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,</a> supposedly a book one should have read if you&#8217;re interested in the interaction between logic and creativity (which I think every scientist should be). Of course, The Little Book of Bathroom Filosofy and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law\">Murphy&#8217;s Law,</a> both of which I got for my birthday are also packed.</p> \t<p>Tomorrow, early in the morning, my parents will pick me up to first go to a hotel in <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=freiburg,+germany&amp;spn=.200820,.288649&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en\">Freiburg</a> and then arrive in Leukerbad on Monday.</p>"
