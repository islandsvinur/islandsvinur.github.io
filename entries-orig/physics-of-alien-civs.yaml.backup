    "Sebastiaan":http://sebas.punt.nl/ gave me a link to an "interesting
    article by Michio Kaku about the physics of advanced alien
    civilizations":http://mkaku.org/home/?page_id=246
    ("PDF":/files/screenshot-physics-of-alien-civs.pdf in case the link doesn't
    work) and how far we are of becoming an advanced civilization.
    
    Kaku asks himself the question "How advanced could they possibly be?" and
    answers it in this article. He divides civilizations in different types:
    Type I, II, and III, which have mastered planetary, stellar and galactic
    forms of energy, respectively.  Earth's society is a Type 0 civilization
    currently and he expects us to reach level I in about 200 years. Read this
    article only if you're interested in planets!
