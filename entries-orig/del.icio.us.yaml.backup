title: Del.icio.us
author: christian
content: <p>Created a <a href="http://del.icio.us/AntiChris">del.icio.us account</a> and imported all of my bookmarks. I&#8217;ll probably still have to retag stuff and make the titles somewhat better. Now if there would be a browser plugin which in realtime fetches the bookmarks and if you add them locally they will get submitted&#8230;</p> <p><em>Nope, I have nothing to do with the del.icio.us power outage just hours after I created the account ;-)</em></p> <p>I also updated my <a href="http://www.technorati.com/profile/ChristianLuijten">Technorati profile</a> &#8211; yeah, I have such a thing, still dunno why &#8211; to the &#8220;new&#8221; location of the journal. There I found out that I apparantly had <a href="http://kochtagebuch.blogspot.com/2005/10/gudsch-kommt-zum-mittagessen.html">dinner with some Austrian guy</a> last October :-)</p>
