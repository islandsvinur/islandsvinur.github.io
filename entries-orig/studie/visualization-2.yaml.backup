title: "Fluids: My First OS X Application release"
author: christian
content: <p>Hooray! I actually managed today to get my <a href="http://luijten.org/personal/study/visualization-1.html">visualization</a> compiled and running under Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span>. It wasn&#8217;t that hard after all, just finding the right libraries to include.</p> 	<h3><span class="caps">GLUT</span>&#8230; <span class="caps">X11</span> or Aqua?</h3> 	<p>glut.h exists in <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> as well as in <span class="caps">OS X</span>, the former binds to <span class="caps">X11</span>, while the latter does the OpenGL directly in Aqua. When I found out about this, it was easy. I now only need Fink for the <a href="http://www.fftw.org/">fast fourier transform library</a>.</p> 	<h3><span class="caps">NEXTSTEP</span> Application Bundles</h3> 	<p>Then the next challenge came, creating a real application bundle&#8230; Again not very hard, it&#8217;s just putting files in the right location and relinking the libraries.</p> 	<p>So, now there is one little thing left, Universal Binaryness. But I can live with this result. It needs a pretty icon by the way.</p> 	<p><img src="http://luijten.org/image/study/streamlines-0.0.1.png" alt="" /></p> 	<ul> 	<li><a href="http://luijten.org/files/fluids/Fluids-powerpc-0.0.1.dmg">Fluids 0.0.1 powerpc</a></li> 	<li><a href="http://luijten.org/files/fluids/Fluids-i386-0.0.1.dmg">Fluids 0.0.1 intel</a></li> 	</ul> 	<p>I fixed some last bits in the streamlines and found a bug that was festering along all the time without really getting noticed. The source is included in the bundle, by the way.</p> 	<p>Last stage, implementing isolines. Then I&#8217;ll write a report about it all and then hopefully <a href="http://luijten.org/personal/study/trimester-4.2.html">after more than a year</a> I can finish the <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~alext/COURSES/INFO_VIS/">Visualization course</a>.</p>
