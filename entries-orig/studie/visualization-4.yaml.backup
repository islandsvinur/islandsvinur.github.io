author: christian
content: "<p>Well, so much for the practical part of the assignment, this is the version I&#8217;ll probably deliver end of this week. Added since the last pre-release are three types of isolines: Based on fixed levels, based on a fixed number of lines, based on fixed points in space. Also, it can do fullscreen, yay!</p> \t<p class=\"right\"><img src=\"http://luijten.org/image/study/fluids-isolines.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \t<p>So, I hereby release version 0.1 of <a href=\"http://nogates.nl/fluids/\">Fluids</a> and name it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox\">Equinox</a>, since that&#8217;s exactly what is going to happen tomorrow at 0:07 <span class=\"caps\">UTC</span>. The days are becoming longer and longer, and starting tomorrow, they&#8217;ll be longer in Iceland than they are here again. Spring&#8217;s here!</p> \t<ul> \t<li><a href=\"http://luijten.org/files/fluids/Fluids-i386-0.1.0.dmg\">Fluids 0.1 intel</a></li> \t<li><a href=\"http://luijten.org/files/fluids/Fluids-powerpc-0.1.0.dmg\">Fluids 0.1 powerpc</a></li> \t<li><a href=\"http://luijten.org/files/fluids/fluids-0.1.0.tgz\">Fluids source code</a></li> \t</ul>"
