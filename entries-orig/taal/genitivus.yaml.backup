title: The genitive is in grave danger
author: christian
content: "<p>Indo-European languages all had this beautiful case system with at least four base cases, nomenative, accusative, dative and genitive (which is the Icelandic order) and usually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grammatical_cases\">a few more</a>.</p> \t<p>In many languages however, including Dutch, those cases have almost completely disappeared. We have remnants of cases in our personal pronouns (ik (nom.), mij (acc.), mijn (dat./gen.)), put &#8217;s&#8217; behind words to indicate ownership (i.e. a simple genitivus form) and do weird things (they&#8217;re in fact inflections) with adjectives (&#8220;sometimes&#8221; add &#8216;e&#8217; suffix), but otherwise they&#8217;re completely gone.</p> \t<p>In some languages which still have cases, such as German and Icelandic, the genitivus tends to disappear slowly in favor of a construction using the dativus.</p> \t<p><a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Dativ_ist_dem_Genitiv_sein_Tod\">Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod</a> is an example of a sentence which doesn&#8217;t use the genitive but the dative instead, and becoming more and more common in spoken language. It is already pretty common to use this construction in Dutch (&#8220;De dativus is de genitivus zijn dood&#8221;) and now look what this language has become! The sentences &#8220;Der Dativ ist der Tod des Genitivs&#8221; or even &#8220;Der Dativ ist des Genitivs Tod&#8221; say exactly the same and are more aestetically pleasing.</p> \t<p>In Icelandic the genitive is used extensively for creating adjectives out of nouns: &#8220;R&aacute;&eth;h&uacute;si&eth; Reykjav&iacute;kur&#8221; (City Hall of Reykjavik), &#8220;Flugst&ouml;&eth; Leifs Eir&iacute;kssonar&#8221; (Leifur Eiriksson Airterminal). However, here also the genitive is threatened by the dative in the sense that they will probably merge somewhere in the next 200 years.</p> \t<p>As a citizen of a case-deprived country I would like to say to those lucky enough to still have them: Save and protect them!</p> \t<p>And to those living in case-deprived countries having to learn a highly inflectional language: There will be a day when the penny drops and all of a sudden it just comes naturally, believe me.</p>"
