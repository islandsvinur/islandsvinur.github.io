title: Blog migrated to GitHub Pages and Jekyll
---
A few weeks ago I started migrating the blog off my own VPS into [GitHub
Pages](http://pages.github.com/). At first, I tried Octopress which is a set of
templates, scripts and plugins for Jekyll that make blogging easier on the
platform. I found it to be impractical and inflexible compared to good old
Hobix, my current blogging platform.

Then I tried to put the actual Hobix installation in GitHub to basically
achieve the same setup as Octopress. However, since Hobix isn't maintained
anymore for over 5 years I found it more wise to migrate to a more modern
system.
