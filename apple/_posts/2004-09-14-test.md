I was trying to install Debian with a newer version, but that was no success at all.

    ...ok
    opening display /pci@0,f0000000/ATY.WhelkParent@10/ATY,Whelk_B@1 ... ok
    copying OF device tree ... done
    starting cpu /cpus/PowerPC,G5 ... failed: 00000000
    Initializing fake screen: ATY,Whelk_A
    Calling quiesce...
    returning 0x01400000 from prom_init

...and then silence. Well, not completely, because the fans start blowing after
some time... And they can get really loud indeed!
