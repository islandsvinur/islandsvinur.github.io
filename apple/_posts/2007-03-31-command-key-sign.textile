<p class="right"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/place-of-interest-sign.png" alt="" /></p> 	<p>When I came to Iceland, I saw the same symbol the command key on Apple keyboard carries (&#8984;) everywhere there was something interesting to see. It is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John%27s_Arms">Saint Hannes cross</a> and is an old viking symbol and now used in the Nordic countries and Estonia to denote sites of touristic interest.</p> 	<p>I wondered about this and apparantly there is a funny <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&#38;story=Swedish_Campground.txt">anecdote</a> about how the &#8220;clover&#8221; sign as some refer to it came on the command key.</p> 	<p>When Steve Jobs first saw the large application menus of the MacDraw application, he saw a list full of &#63743; logos. He didn&#8217;t like this, thought it would take the logo in vain and ordered them to find another symbol to take its place.</p> 	<p><strong>Update</strong>: Hmm, I forgot to mention that I keep running into the clover. Those were actually the reason for this post!</p> 	<p>German band <a href="http://www.silbermond.de/">Silbermond</a> uses it on the cover of their newest album &#8216;Laut gedacht&#8217;. No idea why, but they have one track called &#8216;Das Ende vom Kreis&#8217;. The End of the Circle as universal symbol of infinity and is &#8984; the new one?</p> 	<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirteen_and_a_Half_Lives_of_Captain_Bluebear">Die 13 1/2 Leben des K&auml;pt&#8217;n Blaub&auml;r</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Moers">Walter Moers</a>, the protagonist lands inside the Eternal Tornado which is describing a course in the form of the Saint Hannes cross of about two thousand kilometers long.</p>
