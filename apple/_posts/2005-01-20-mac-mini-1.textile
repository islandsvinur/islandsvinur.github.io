<p>Apple introduced this new product family called <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> on MacWorld San Francisco last week, but since Orion was down, I couldn&#8217;t write anything about it&#8230;</p> 	<p><img src="http://luijten.org/image/mac-mini.png" class="left" alt="" /> Targeted at switchers who already have a good monitor, this little wonder of micro-computing might also come in handy as a portable movie player with TV-out. Hmm, have to think about it, â¬ 499,- still is a lot of money for a <span class="caps">DVD</span>-player :).</p>
