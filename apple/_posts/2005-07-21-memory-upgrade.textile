<p>Today, I had completely had it with the swapping and other memory issues in <span class="caps">OS X</span>, so I went to the <a href="http://www.computerland.nl/">Computerland</a> and bought two very nice and not-so-very-pricy Kingston <span class="caps">DDR PC3200 256MB</span> parts and installed them in my Mac.</p> 	<p>To open the case and install the memory exactly zero screws are to be unscrewed and exactly one tool, namely one of your fingers, is needed: Open the external case latch, remove the aluminum plate, remove the plastic air deflector shield thingy, remove the two fans in front of the <span class="caps">CPU</span> cooling block by just pulling them out. Insert your <span class="caps">RAM</span> banks, put everything back in place and boot the system&#8230; Yes, very easy, even an idiot could do it. And to prove that, I forgot to put the fans back in :-)</p> 	<p><img src="http://luijten.org/image/memory-1gb.png" class="left" alt="" /> I already can feel some grave differences between 512 MB and 1 GB. For instance, calling the Dashboard is a lot more responsive, the harddisks have more time off, switching between programs isn&#8217;t as slow anymore&#8230; Of course, there is also the excitement factor, the improvements might not be this great, but there actually are improvements and that&#8217;s good.</p> 	<p>It has to be said, my moments with Linux (albeit short and few) were better than what <span class="caps">OS X</span> does to the memory. Much can be improved here on Apple&#8217;s behalf, I think.</p>
