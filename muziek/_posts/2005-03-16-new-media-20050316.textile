<p>Today I picked up <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168629/">Dancer in the Dark</a> (starring BjÃ¶rk) and <a href="http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/agaetis.html">ÃgÃ¦tis Byrjun</a> (by Sigur RÃ³s) at the Free Record Shop, which I ordered two weeks ago. Both took a bit longer than was to be expected.</p> 	<p>Since I was in the city anyway, I decided to hop by the local Apple Centre to take a good look at the Mac mini. On my way back I went to Van Leest and bought <a href="http://unit.bjork.com/specials/albums/homogenic/">Homogenic</a> by BjÃ¶rk.</p> 	<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering what he&#8217;s doing with all this Icelandic stuff lately&#8230; Indeed, I&#8217;m intrigued by this little country in the northwestern corner of Europe and its people, language, culture&#8230; I would really like to go there some day and see for myself, maybe even do an internship? <a href="http://www.estherermers.nl/">Esther</a> must have infected me with the Iceland virus ;-)</p> 	<p>Meanwhile in Eindhoven, the weather is nice, it&#8217;s not too hot, yet warm enough to sit on a terrace in the sun. Knowing Dutch weather however, this isn&#8217;t going to last long and the weather will change in a few days.</p>
