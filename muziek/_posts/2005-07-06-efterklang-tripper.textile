This combined with the soft voices and acoustic instruments (trumpet, flÃ¼gelhorn, piano) gives the music this very unique sound</p> 	<p>Efterklang is a Danish group and the name means something like aftersound, or reverberation. On the album Tripper they play together with <a href="http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/media/intervi/amina1.html">Amina,</a> who already had done ( ) with <a href="http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/">Sigur RÃ³s.</a></p> 	<p>You can download the video clip for Swarming <a href="http://www.posteverything.com/leaf/efterklang/swarming.mov">(Quicktime)</a> <a href="http://www.posteverything.com/leaf/efterklang/swarming.wmv">(WMV)</a> from the groups <a href="http://www.posteverything.com/artists/release.php?id=8102">web shop</a> which gives a very good idea of their music.</p>
