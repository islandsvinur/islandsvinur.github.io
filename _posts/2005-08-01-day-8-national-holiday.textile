<p>Another uncle joined us today, he is in Switzerland at friends and wanted to spend 1 August with us, it&#8217;s becoming a family party!</p> 	<p>The Swiss of Leukerbad commemorate the birthday of their homeland with a large barbecue in the town center, music and fireworks. We did it with a (typically Swiss) cheese fondue, loads of Swiss wine and Toblerone chocolate. In the afternoon I had an ice-coupe Suisse with a Rivella&#8230; Yes, Hop Schwyz! Hop Schwyz!</p> 	<p>The fireworks were impressive, not so much because of the visual effects (which were great, some of them I&#8217;ve never seen before), but mainly because of the enourmous growl which follows after each bang. Remember that Leukerbad lies between two mountains and every sound is reflected multiple times before dimming out, resulting in a massive wall of sound.</p>
