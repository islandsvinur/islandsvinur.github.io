<p>Extreme bargain alert! I got this 3CD plus a <span class="caps">DVD</span> with the complete recordings of The Fellowship of the Ring at a ridiculous price of â¬5,95 at Makro&#8230; Something of a 90% discount off the Amazon-prize. Someone really must have messed things up since I&#8217;ve seen it at said Makro for something around â¬ 40,- not too long ago.</p> 	<p><img src="http://luijten.org/image/photos/fotr-complete-recordings.png" alt="" /></p> 	<p>Contents:</p> 	<ul> 	<li>A booklet with information on the various themes in the music, certainly an interesting read.</li> 	<li>3CDs with the complete musical sound track of the first of the Lord of the Rings movies.</li> 	<li>1DVD which contains the same music, only now in four formats: standard Dolby Digital Stereo and Surround and in 48kHz 24bit Advanced Resolution Surround and Stereo Sound. Anyone who can play <span class="caps">DVD</span>-Audio?</li> 	</ul> 	<p>It seems that software to play the <span class="caps">DVD</span>-Audio portion (it&#8217;s what goes in the <span class="caps">AUDIO</span>_TS directory on a <span class="caps">DVD</span>) simply doesn&#8217;t exist. One has to have a hardware player for it, but now the same hardware players are dropping support for it in favour of HD content.</p> 	<p>I really enjoy this &#8220;Extended Edition&#8221; of the soundtrack, it&#8217;s fun to picture the complete film along with the music :)</p>
