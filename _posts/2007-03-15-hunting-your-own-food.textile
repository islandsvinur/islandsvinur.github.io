<p>Walking dinner&#8230; or&#8230; hunting your own food. It is a yearly activity at Isis and usually one of the best-attended ones (most probably because there&#8217;s food involved). I don&#8217;t have exact numbers, but making an wild guess I would say about 35-40 out of the total 100 members were present.</p> 	<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the concept, a small introduction. Everyone gets three addresses where they&#8217;re going to have entry, main dish and dessert, along with what they&#8217;re going to make themselves. You get this of course far too late to prepare properly and you don&#8217;t really have time to arrange much.</p> 	<p>So, Jacco and I were a &#8220;team&#8221; so to speak and had our entry course, mustard pea soup with lots of smoked sausage at Rinka&#8217;s house at 6pm&#8230; Others at the table were Maarten, Erwin, Andre, Juli&euml;n, and Marcel.</p> 	<p><img src="http://luijten.org/image/photos/walking-dinner.png" alt="" /> Then, at half past seven we rushed home to prepare our main course: cheese fondue. Man, that&#8217;s the last time I attempt that at a walking dinner :&ETH; All was good, it just takes soooo much time to melt the cheese properly. We got Herjan, Lisa, Sibrecht, Floor, Wouter, and Michiel for dinner.</p> 	<p>Barely making the two hours planned for dinner, we arrived a little late at Roel&#8217;s, where the Tiramis&ugrave; was already waiting for Sandra, Mijke, Maresa, and us.</p> 	<p>Afterwards, we met in caf&eacute; Spijker and thus and there the walking dinner 2007 was concluded.</p> 	<p>I would say, it was very successful, we had a lot of fun and I&#8217;m looking forward to next year&#8217;s walking dinner. Hopefully I won&#8217;t have to make the main dish then, it&#8217;s fun to do, but also a bit stressy.</p> 	<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are <a href="http://www.essvisis.nl/nieuw/fotos/fotos.php?action=album&#38;id=180">photos</a> online.</p>
