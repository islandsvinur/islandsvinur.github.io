<p>This probably is the most pointless entry in this journal to date.</p> 	<p class="center"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/photos/rivella-switzerland.png" alt="" /> <br /> <em>Drinking Rivella from a Swiss souvenir glass</em></p> 	<p>Hmmm, nice ;-) Actually, Rivella <em>is</em> nice. It is mainly made of components of milk. Rivella calls this colourless liquid &#8220;milk serum&#8221; and is the residue of milk when proteins and fats are removed. It contains no sugar (no sugar as in saccharose, it <em>does</em> contain lactose) and it tasts just great (when you&#8217;re accustomed to it).</p>
