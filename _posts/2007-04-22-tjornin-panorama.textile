<p>This is the last panorama from Iceland I have, made on my last weekend there, when it after some days of frost suddenly started snowing and the frozen-over lake Tj&ouml;rnin (The Pond) in the center of Reykjav&iacute;k became a big snowfield.</p> 	<p class="center"><a href="http://luijten.org/photos/iceland/tjornin-panorama-small.jpg"><img src="http://luijten.org/photos/iceland/tjornin-panorama-very-small.jpg" alt="" /></a></p> 	<p>On the far left, in the distance, the Askja building of the University of Iceland can be seen, where I had my introduction to the Icelandic language and culture in August. On the far right is the modern city hall of the city of Reykjav&iacute;k.</p>
