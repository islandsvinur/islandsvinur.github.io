<p><img src="http://luijten.org/image/canon-box.png" alt="" /> Today, the <span class="caps">UPS</span> courier brought a large box, containing my all new <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_350d/index.asp">Canon <span class="caps">EOS</span> 350D.</a> I only ordered it Wednesday from <a href="http://www.topvision.com/">TopVision</a> in Luxembourg, got the confirmation yesterday and today it was already in the Netherlands.</p> 	<p>Mwuhahaha! Fear, for I have a camera!</p> 	<p>Since the camera is delivered without flash memory, I was orienting about what cards are fast enough for the 8 Mpixel images (<a href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=6007-7699">a side-by-side test of many cards</a>). Of course, the top items &#8211; mainly SanDisk Ultra II and Extreme <span class="caps">III</span>, followed by cards of Lexar &#8211; can&#8217;t be found anywhere on such short notice. So, I got a plain and simple Dane-Elec card from <span class="caps">BCC</span> and was prepared for a slow shooting&#8230; That became a positive disappointment, storing a full-size fine <span class="caps">JPEG</span> costs less than a second. I guess the speed differences between cards become more apparant when shooting <span class="caps">RAW</span> format. Okay, so no need to spend loads of cash on flashcards.</p> 	<p>This Sunday is <a href="http://www.harley-dag.com/">Harleyday</a> in Breda and it will be the vuurdoop, I hope I will get some nice shots (and nice weather, too).</p>
