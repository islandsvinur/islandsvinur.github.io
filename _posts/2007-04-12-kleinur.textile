<p>Kleinur (sg. kleina) are a tasty type of Icelandic cookie. They&#8217;re deep fried, and have a taste reminiscent of grandmother&#8217;s apple pie without the apples. So basically they taste like cookie :-)</p> 	<p class="center"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/iceland/kleinur.png" alt="" /></p> 	<p>The recipe is pretty simple, take 85 grams of butter and 200 grams of sugar and mix them. Add an egg, baking powder and baker&#8217;s ammonia (I tried to get this here, but failed, even in the biological supermarket and at the local bakery, maybe I&#8217;ll try again next time I&#8217;m in Germany &#8211; they tend to have <em>every</em> possible bakery supply at any supermarket), graped zest of a lemon, some cardamom, and 100 ml yoghurt or buttermilk (actually you should use s&uacute;rmj&oacute;lk but that&#8217;s unavailable outside Iceland). Mix this very well and add up to 700 grams of flour, preferably less until you have a smooth dough.</p> 	<p>Split the dough in a few pieces and flatten them until quite thin, cut 3cm by 6-8cm diamonds, cut a slit diagonally, take one corner and turn it through the slit.</p> 	<p>Put the kleinur in a frying pan at 180 degrees, after 1 to 2 minutes they&#8217;re nicely brown coloured. Eat hot with cold milk or cold with coffee.</p> 	<p>During J&oacute;lat&iacute;&eth;, so around Christmas, they&#8217;re served with chocolate icing. Also very nice.</p>
