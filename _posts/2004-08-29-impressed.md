<p>After playing around with <span class="caps">OS X I</span> must say, I&#8217;m impressed. It is something you need to get used to, because it just works a little bit different. For instance, I keep forgetting there is a menubar of the running program all at the top of the screen. Over to the design of the machine itself. The materials used are of very high quality. It is put together very well, everything fits exactly. I only have one single point of critic, the screws of the <span class="caps">PCI</span> slots are a bit hard to (un)screw; the frame is in the way. I looked into the <span class="caps">DVD</span>/CD drive bay to look if it is just an ordinary drive, and it is, so you can just put any <span class="caps">ATA</span> drive in there. Oh, and one other thing about the material, it is very prone to dirt ;-)</p>
