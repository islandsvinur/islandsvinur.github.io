<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval">Carnaval</a> is well over by now. In the Netherlands, it is fairly common for a city to have a different name, I was in Breda at my parents&#8217;, which is called Kielegat during Carnaval.</p> 	<p class="center"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/photos/carnaval-2006.png" alt="" /></p> 	<p>Sunday was the <a href="http://p.hot.os.luijten.org/2006/Feb/Grote_Optocht_in_Boemeldonck_1.html">big parade in Prinsenbeek</a> or better: Boemeldonck. Prinsenbeek is a village (population 11.000) right next to Breda and it has a large tradition of carnaval. Everyone seems to be in some way connected to the celebrations, via one of the many carnaval clubs, or active in the organization of activities during carnaval.</p>
