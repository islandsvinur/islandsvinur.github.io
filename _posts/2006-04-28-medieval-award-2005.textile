<p>Alright, so I got this Medieval Award the other day. Medieval? Award? Doesn&#8217;t really ring a bell right&#8230; Okay, so Medieval is a <span class="caps">MOO</span>, which can be seen as an online community avant-la-lettre; it&#8217;s really lo-tech in today&#8217;s Internet technology. So far, so good.</p> 	<p>I created this together with the other &#8216;Guardians&#8217; quite a while ago in 1999. We were friends from Breda and The Hague and we wanted to create an online world set in the Middle Ages, using our and other&#8217;s fantasy as guideline. Our world grew and grew and at some point caught the attention of a whole slew of Pijnacker-persons. Now, the community strangely enough is grown quite close to eachother, despite the fact that most users wouldn&#8217;t be compatible at all in &#8220;real life&#8221; (I put it between quotes because it seems to turn out the way we feel &#8216;what real life is&#8217; is changing).</p> 	<p class="center"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/photos/medieval-award-2005.png" alt="" /> <br /> <em>Medieval Award 2005</em></p> 	<p>I got the award already begin April, on Medieval&#8217;s birthday meeting, but I couldn&#8217;t/wouldn&#8217;t come no matter how much they pushed (well, now I know why they did :)). Anyway, this award I received in the mail today was for the many years of administration of the server and database. I really appreciate this gesture since the system administrator is often forgotten. It encourages me to continue what I&#8217;m doing. Ah, and I should mention the fact that Peeg and DarkShadow also received the award for their work to keep Medieval up and running.</p>
