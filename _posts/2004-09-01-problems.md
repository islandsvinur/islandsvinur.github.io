So, I'm having some problems with my machine, of which I'm not sure it is
because of the machine or from external factors.

Firstly, the network is sometimes very unstable, I cannot even watch the
AppleExpo keynote at 300kbps (I have a 10MBit connection) and (incoming) ssh
connections also suffer from instability.

Secondly, the machine tends to overheat itself and then just go into suspend,
of course only if I'm away.

Thirdly, it is a bit loud at night, so I can't sleep with it on.
