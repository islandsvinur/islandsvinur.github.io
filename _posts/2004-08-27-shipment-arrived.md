<p>Yes! What no one ever expected (ahum) has happened. Today, extremely early (8:02), a mailman of <span class="caps">TNT</span> came to my parents house with a big box and a bag&#8230; Looks like I have to go home now, but I have to work a couple of hours first; my last workday, on Monday university is starting again.</p> 	<p>All in all, the G5 made a very interesting route starting from Cork, via Arnhem, Eindhoven, Venray, back to Eindhoven, Rotterdam and only then it was in Breda&#8230; It probably was transported from Eindhoven to Rotterdam over the highway <span class="caps">A58</span>, which runs directly to Breda. So, once again it was very near its destination&#8230; Efficient driving and shortest path can&#8217;t be combined or at least not both at their maximum.</p>
