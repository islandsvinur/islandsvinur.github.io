<p>The nice people at <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/"><span class="caps">FOSDEM</span></a> recorded their main talks and put them online, sadly without giving a playlist, so you have to click each link each time you want to play something.</p> 	<p>So here you are, a <a href="http://luijten.org/files/FOSDEM2007.m3u">playlist for your comfort</a>.</p>
