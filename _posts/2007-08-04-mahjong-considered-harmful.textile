From "BBC News Web Site":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6931119.stm:

<blockquote> 	

A study by doctors in Hong Kong has concluded that epilepsy can be induced
by the Chinese tile game of mahjong.

Nota that this is not about the solitaire game, but the one you play with
four players.

<blockquote>

The game, which is intensely social and sometimes played in crowded mahjong
parlours, involves the rapid movement of tiles in marathon sessions.

The doctors conclude that the syndrome affects far more men than women;
that their average age is 54; and that it can hit sufferers anywhere
between one to 11 hours into a mahjong game.
