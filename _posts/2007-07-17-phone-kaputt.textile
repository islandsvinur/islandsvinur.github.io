<p>To anyone having my cellphone number; my phone is broken and is now turned off pretty much all the time. It had a hole in the display for a few weeks, now the keys 2, 5, 8, and 0 don&#8217;t work anymore.</p> 	<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve been to the Vodafone store, where they could tell me that on August 9, my contract will enter its 3 last months and I can choose between a new phone or a <span class="caps">SIM</span>-only discount. So I&#8217;ll just wait for that and see what they&#8217;ll have on offer by then. The keys magically started working again, by the way.</p>
