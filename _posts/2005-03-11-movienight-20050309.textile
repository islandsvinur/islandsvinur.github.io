<p>Like every Thursday, it was Spacelabs movie night. Rico joined the movie watchers club, so we had to have a re-run on a previous movie. Tonight we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298148/">Shrek 2</a> (second time) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/">Napoleon Dynamite</a> (third time now).</p> 	<p>The absolute stupidity of the things that happen in Napoleon Dynamite astound me time and time again. It&#8217;s just brilliant how someone can make a movie that must have a storyline of about one A4 paper, yet make it a full one and a half hour feature film. The humor consists mainly of painfully recognizable embarrassing moments on the part of Napoleon and the absolute idiocy of his brother and uncle.</p> 	<p>Well, I&#8217;ve had enough Napoleon for a while now. Next time we&#8217;ll really need a little more intelligent movie. Oh, and thanks Rico for the beer and baguette, that&#8217;ll have to be made up to you somehow.</p>
