<p>Yeeeh, <a href="http://www.rivella.nl/">Rivella</a> is going to be marketed throughout Europe, according to the readers of <a href="http://frank-ly.nl/">Frank-ly</a>! (Hint: whois drinkme.nl, Heineken is owner of Vrumona, thanks to the research-fu of the visitors of <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Frank-ly/~3/115829205/drinken-in-het-openbaar">Frank-ly</a> ;-))</p> 	<p><strong>Update</strong>: Yes! As a little &#8216;thank you&#8217; note for all the free advertisement, Vrumona decided to put the stuff in new soft <span class="caps">PET</span> bottles (yuck) and raised the price by 20%! Hooray! As a side note, Schweppes&#8217; stuff is also affected by this.</p>
