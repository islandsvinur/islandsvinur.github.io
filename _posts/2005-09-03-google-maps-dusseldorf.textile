<p>Hmm, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.263311,6.771698&#38;spn=0.093881,.138127&#38;t=k&#38;hl=en">D&uuml;sseldorf now has two airports,</a> one on the original location and one in the Rhine where the Theodor Heuss Bridge used to be? Of course I <a href="http://www.google.com/support/maps/bin/request.py?contact_type=report">reported</a> this to Google.</p> 	<p>It&#8217;s quite an old photo, the bridge over the Rhine they are building in the left is in service a few years already.</p> 	<p><strong>Update</strong>: In the meantime, Google Maps was updated extensively (higher resolution pictures are now available of the area) and the error has been removed.</p>
