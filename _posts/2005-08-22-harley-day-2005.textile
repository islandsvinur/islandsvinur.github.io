<p>Nice weather, &#8220;some&#8221; (i.e. around 8000) nice bikes, but not so nice to take pictures. Why not? Downtown was full, completely packed. About 75000 people thought of going to watch and taking 50 pictures of the same pose but of a different model isn&#8217;t really interesting to watch. I nevertheless <a href="http://photos.luijten.org/Christian/2005/2005-08-21.%20Harleydag%20Breda/">took some</a> and put them in my Luijten.org dump-repository.</p> 	<p>Ah, I guess there are some allright, but not that great.</p> 	<ul> 	<li><a href="http://photos.luijten.org/Christian/2005/2005-08-21.%20Harleydag%20Breda/IMG_0273.jpg">Indian</a></li> 	<li><a href="http://photos.luijten.org/Christian/2005/2005-08-21.%20Harleydag%20Breda/IMG_0275.jpg">Reflections</a></li> 	<li><a href="http://photos.luijten.org/Christian/2005/2005-08-21.%20Harleydag%20Breda/IMG_0276.jpg">Reflections II</a></li> 	</ul> 	<p><a href="http://photos.luijten.org/Christian/2002/2002-08-18.%20Harleydag%20Breda/dscf2521.jpg">This one: 3 Heritage Softails</a> from the 2002 edition actually was better, but I couldn&#8217;t find a nice set of bikes so nicely arranged this year, it was a mess.</p>
