I'm losing interest in installing Debian on my Mac; OS X is very nice after
all. Meanwhile, the Debian PowerPC project is quarreling about going 64-bit all
the way or just the kernel.

Patrons argue that the amd64 team does exactly the same, while they could have
a 32-bit userspace. Opposers argue that the archive is large enough already and
it isn't really profitable to have 64-bit binaries.

In Ubuntu, PPC64 support has been postponed as a long term goal.

So, the only way I could get Linux on my machine is using Gentoo, but I don't
want to compile each and every little package until I get a working system, I
want a system that "Just Worksâ„¢".
