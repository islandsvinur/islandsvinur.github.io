<p>Went to see <a href="http://www.gathering.nl/">The Gathering</a> in <a href="http://www.mezz.nl/">Mezz</a> yesterday.</p> 	<p>An &#8220;audiovisual show&#8221; was announced, well, the audio part was excellent. Too bad the visual part didn&#8217;t really stand out. <span class="caps">A VJ</span> would show clips made by Dutch video-artists, mixing with the music. But they didn&#8217;t match at all, except of course the video clip of Souvenirs itself.</p> 	<p>I noticed too that at least one part wasn&#8217;t by a Dutch video-artist as it came directly from the ending sequence of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0085809/">Koyaanisqatsi</a> by Godfrey Reggio and music by Philip Glass: The launch of a Saturn V and crash of another vessel (don&#8217;t know if it was manned or unmanned, don&#8217;t even know its name). Ok, so the video part was nice, but a bit disappointing.</p> 	<p>Well, back to the musicians and their music, where we were all there for after all. Anneke is now five and a half months pregnant and that was very visible. I wonder if her baby will once become such a good singer, too :-)</p> 	<blockquote> 	<p>02-08-2004: Dear Gatherers, I am 3 months pregnant! As happy as I was, that&#8217;s how sick I was as well. I took the pregnancy-nausea to a whole new level. :-) Now all is well again and I look forward to carrying both, the baby as well as the upcoming tours and the rest of the year to a blazing end. Many greetings, Anneke</p> 	</blockquote> 	<p>I really liked the long &#8220;jamming&#8221; part on Black Light District (starting from 7:46 on the album running for about two minutes), basically it was just 5 minutes playing exactly the same accord, but after a while I started to hear some melody in it. Very strange and for everyone a diffent one probably. The crowd loved it and Anneke and RenÃ©, who play the guitar, too. The whole performance of it was perfect, totally different from an album recording, just like how a live show should be.</p> 	<p>Maybe they should do the same special thing with every song they play.</p> 	<p>Next month, 25th of November, Vive la FÃªte will be performing in Mezz. I&#8217;ll have to see if I&#8217;m going.</p>
