Of course, flatmate <a href="http://estherermers.nl/">Esther Ermers</a> who graduated last December was there with her Spinning abc. She created 26 stools out of the letters of the (Dutch) alphabet.</p> 	<p class="center"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/graduation-2005-spinning-abc.jpg" alt="" /> <br /> <em>Esther Ermers, Spinning abc</em></p> 	<p>There was also a project, of which one part was this (sorry for the very bad quality picture):</p> 	<p class="center"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/graduation-2005-led-it-be.jpg" alt="" /> <br /> <em><span class="caps">LED</span> it be</em></p> 	<p>Uhm, OK.
