So my new Mac was due to ship on 20. August, two months after I placed the
order like I wrote in the introduction. According to the tracking page, it has
been picked up by [TNT Express](http://www.tnt.com/) on 20. August. The big
wait is finally coming to an end. [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) had some problems
delivering enough G5 processors to Apple, so [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) had
problems delivering Power Macs to its customers.
