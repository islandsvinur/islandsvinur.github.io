<p class="left"><img src="http://www.reykjavik.to/rotterdam/images/poster1.jpg" alt="" /></p> 	<p>There&#8217;s an interesting festival coming up in November: <a href="http://www.reykjavik.to/rotterdam/">Reykjav&iacute;k to Rotterdam</a>, featuring music, dance, movies and art from our beloved island up north.</p> 	<p>Gigs I&#8217;d be interested in attending are Hafd&iacute;s Huld and Apparat Organ Quartet, but then there are also the movies, with Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur present for Q and A. Full programme already.</p> 	<p>I&#8217;ll have to see what will come of that, as usual I tend to overestimate my time and money ;)</p> 	<p>Funny thing I noticed that I once met the secretary of the festival at the <a href="http://luijten.org/personal/music/sigur-ros-paradiso-2.html">Sigur R&oacute;s concert back in July 2005</a>... Small world :)</p>
