<p>All right, everything is nice and shiny again. Orion, my &#8220;personal&#8221; server got a reinstall and a backup restore right after that. I hope it will be a bit more stable now, since it got uptimes of about&#8230; 3 days at max.</p> 	<p>So, my journal and website are back from hibernation. I don&#8217;t suppose you missed them :-)</p>
