<p>This weekend I was at my parents&#8217;, so no playing around with my Mac. Sunday me and my cousins went to <a href="http://www.sixflags.nl/" class="ext">Six Flags Holland</a> I really liked the <a href="http://www.rcdb.com/installationdetail1565.htm" class="ext">Goliath</a> which was so&#8230; different from what I had experienced before (and that is not much to be honest). It was my first non-<a href="http://www.vekoma.nl/" class="ext">Vekoma</a> coaster and what a difference indeed!</p> 	<blockquote> 	<p><strong>Update:</strong> Actually, it wasn&#8217;t my first non-Vekoma, Big Thunder Mountain (Disneyland Paris) and Bobbaan (Efteling) are no Vekoma rides.</p> 	</blockquote> 	<p>While Vekomas tend to rattle and shake, this one, of <a href="http://www.intaminworldwide.com/" class="ext">Intamin AG</a> was smooth like a snake. Some nice &gt;&nbsp;90Â° banks and air time on the bunny hops.</p> 	<p>Aw, well, I think <a href="http://www.rcdb.com/installationdetail769.htm" class="ext">Superman the Ride</a> is also funny with its linear motor, but that is more because it is a technical challenge to get something heavy at a high speed in short time and on such a short track.</p>
