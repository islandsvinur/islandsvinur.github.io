This weekend I was at my parents', so no playing around with my Mac. Sunday me
and my cousins went to [Six Flags Holland](http://www.sixflags.nl/). I really
liked the [Goliath](http://www.rcdb.com/installationdetail1565.htm) which was
so... different from what I had experienced before (and that is not much to be
honest). It was my first non-[Vekoma](http://www.vekoma.nl/) coaster and what a
difference indeed!

While Vekomas tend to rattle and shake, this one, of [Intamin
AG](http://www.intaminworldwide.com/) was smooth like a snake. Some nice
&gt;&nbsp;90Â° banks and air time on the bunny hops.

Aw, well, I think [Superman the
Ride](http://www.rcdb.com/installationdetail769.htm) is also funny with its
linear motor, but that is more because it is a technical challenge to get
something heavy at a high speed in short time and on such a short track.
