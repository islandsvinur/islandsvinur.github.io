<p>A friend came with a <a href="http://www.apecode.com/appletrack/" class="ext">site</a> where I could get more information about my package than I get from Apple&#8217;s own tracking site. I can see there that it is already in Europe. Cork, Ireland to be exact. It might be handy for you too if you are ordering.</p>
