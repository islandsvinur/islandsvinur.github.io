<p>When we were at Gullfoss, the golden waterfall in the river Hv&iacute;t&aacute; (White River), I took a series of photos. They weren&#8217;t really intended as a panorama, but I could somewhat stitch them together like I did with the <a href="http://luijten.org/tags/panorama/#iceland/jokulsarlon-panorama">J&ouml;kuls&aacute;rl&oacute;n panorama</a>.</p> 	<p class="center"><a href="http://luijten.org/photos/iceland/gullfoss-panorama-small.jpg"><img src="http://luijten.org/photos/iceland/gullfoss-panorama-very-small.jpg" alt="" /></a></p> 	<p>It has lots of stitching errors, there&#8217;s even a person cut in half. Like last time, there is a <a href="http://luijten.org/photos/iceland/gullfoss-panorama-small.jpg">somewhat bigger version</a>.</p>
