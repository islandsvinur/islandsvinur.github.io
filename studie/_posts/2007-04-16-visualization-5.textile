<p>Finally, after two years, I got my grade for the Visualization course today. Not that great, merely a seven, but well, it&#8217;s done.</p> 	<p>I decided that Fluids is a boring name, because it is just an English word. So I renamed it <a href="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/IcelOnline/IcelOnline.TEId-idx?type=entry&#38;eid=VO3KVI&#38;q1=vokvar">V&ouml;kvar</a>, which also is just a word, but at least it&#8217;s an Icelandic one &mdash; intrinsically cooler however &mdash; meaning exactly the same.</p> 	<ul> 	<li><a href="http://luijten.org/files/fluids/Vo%cc%88kvar-i386-1.0.0.dmg">V&ouml;kvar 1.0.0 intel</a> (dmg)</li> 	<li><a href="http://luijten.org/files/fluids/Vo%cc%88kvar-powerpc-1.0.0.dmg">V&ouml;kvar 1.0.0 powerpc</a> (dmg)</li> 	<li><a href="http://luijten.org/files/fluids/vokvar-1.0.0.tgz">V&ouml;kvar 1.0.0 source code</a> (tarball)</li> 	<li><a href="http://luijten.org/files/papers/visualization%20-%20fluids.pdf">Report</a> (pdf)</li> 	</ul> 	<p><strong>Update</strong>: I forgot that the usage is not at all trivial :)</p> 	<p>So, here are some keystrokes that do stuff (they&#8217;re also mentioned in the report):</p> 	<ul> 	<li>1: Switches the &#8220;smoke&#8221; on and off </li> 	<li>2: Switches the speed vectors on and off </li> 	<li>3: Switches the streamlines on and off </li> 	<li>4: Switches the isolines on and off </li> 	<li>p: Switches between palette (rainbow, rainbow with 5 discrete colours, grayscales) </li> 	<li>o: Switches between isolines method (by value, by number, by point) </li> 	<li>a: Temporarily freeze simulation and animation </li> 	<li>f: Switches to and from fullscreen view </li> 	<li>t/T: Changes timestep </li> 	<li>s/S: Changes scale of vectors and streamlines </li> 	<li>v/V: Changes viscosity </li> 	<li>i/I: Changes number of isolines </li> 	<li>q: Quits V&ouml;kvar</li> 	</ul>
