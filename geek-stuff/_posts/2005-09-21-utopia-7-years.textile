<p>I almost cannot believe I am the only one posting about this&#8230;</p> 	<p class="center"><img src="http://luijten.org/image/photos/utopia-7-jaar.jpg" alt="" /></p> 	<p>Last weekend we went with <a href="http://utopiamoo.net/">Utopia</a> on a meeting in the Drenthean village Drouwen, in the bungalow parc Drouwenerzand, right in between Emmen, Groningen and Assen (that&#8217;s in the North of the Netherlands).</p> 	<p>My compliments go to the organization: Paul, Lotte, Sjoerd and Lise, you did a great job, we had three great days!</p>
